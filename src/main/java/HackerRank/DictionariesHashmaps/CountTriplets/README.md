## Problem

You are given an array and you need to find number of tripets of indices (i, j, k) such that the elements at those
indices are in geometric progression for a given common ratio r and i < j < k.

For example, arr = [1, 4, 16, 64]. If r = 4, we have [1, 4, 16] and [4, 16, 64] at indices (0, 1, 2) and (1, 2, 3).

### Function Description

Complete the countTriplets function in the editor below. It should return the number of triplets forming a geometric
progression for a given r as an integer.

countTriplets has the following parameter(s):

* arr: an array of integers
* r: an integer, the common ratio

### Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers n and r, the size of arr and the common ratio.
The next line contains n space-seperated integers arr[i].

### Constraints

* 1 <= n <= 10^5
* 1 <= r <= 10^9
* 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9

### Output Format

Return the count of triplets that form a geometric progression.

### Sample Input 0

```
4 2
1 2 2 4
```

### Sample Output 0

```
2
```

### Explanation 0

There are 2 triplets in satisfying our criteria, whose indices are (0, 1, 3) and (0, 2, 3)

### Sample Input 1

```
6 3
1 3 9 9 27 81
```

### Sample Output 1

```
6
```

### Explanation 1

The triplets satisfying are index (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 3), (1, 2, 4), (1, 3, 4), (2, 4, 5) and (3, 4, 5).

### Sample Input 2

```
5 5
1 5 5 25 125
```

### Sample Output 2

```
4
```

### Explanation 2

The triplets satisfying are index (0, 1, 3), (0, 2, 3), (1, 3, 4), (2, 3, 4).
